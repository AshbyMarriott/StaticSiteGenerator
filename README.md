## Note on use of AI
In developing this project AI tools were utilized for writing docstrings (reviewed and edited by the author) and as a learning tool for getting further examples as well as to assist in debugging. No generated functional code has been used in this project; all implementation logic (with the exception of a few provided unittests from the course) was written by the author.
